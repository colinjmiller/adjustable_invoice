# Adjustable Invoice

Design decisions:
- Embrace KISS principles. Build the most basic web app that works and apply progressive enhancements on top of that. In this app, I minimized Javascript dependencies and even allow users who disable javascript to use the application.
- Audit early and often with an eye on performance and accessibility. I used Google's lighthouse audit tool to get feedback on ways to improve page performance and design.
- Mobile first. I picked a CSS framework called siimple, which provided a light-weight base for theming and components that scale well to different viewports. More info about siimple: https://docs.siimple.xyz/index.html.
